## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Random Maze Generation** 🔀
Each time you play, the maze is randomly generated using a **Depth-First Search** (DFS) algorithm. Every maze is different, so you'll never know what to expect!

### 2. **Smooth Gameplay** 🎮
Control the player using either **WASD** or **Arrow keys** to move through the maze. The character is responsive and smooth, making for a satisfying gameplay experience.

### 3. **Timer and Win Condition** ⏱️🏆
The game tracks how long it takes you to reach the exit. Once you reach the **exit**, a toast message will display your completion time, and you can take a break for a **3-second delay** before the next maze is generated.

### 4. **Dark Theme with Cyan and Teal** 🌑🎨
The game uses a modern dark theme with cool cyan and teal colors, giving it a sleek, tech-inspired look. The player is highlighted in cyan, and the exit is marked in a contrasting teal color.

### 5. **Toast Notification on Win** 🎉
When you win the game, a toast message will appear with your **completion time**! It's a fun and celebratory way to mark your victory!

### 6. **No Movement During Delay** ⏳
After you win and the time is displayed, the game will **disable movement for 3 seconds** before the maze resets. This gives you a brief pause before jumping into the next round.
